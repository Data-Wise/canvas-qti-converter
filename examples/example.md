# Pool: Statistics Final Exam

# Section: Descriptive Statistics

## 1. The mean of a normal distribution is denoted by \( \mu \). Which statement is true? [2 pts]

1) **It equals both the median and the mode** ✓
2) It equals only the median
3) It equals only the mode
4) It is always greater than the median

## 2. A z-score of 0 indicates: [2 pts]

1) **The value equals the mean** ✓
2) The value is one standard deviation above the mean
3) The distribution is perfectly normal
4) The variance is zero

## 3. [TF] The standard deviation can be negative. → False

# Section: Mediation Analysis

## 4. In mediation, the indirect effect equals: [2 pts]

1) c (the total effect)
2) **a × b (the product of paths a and b)** ✓
3) c' (the direct effect)
4) a + b

## 5. The equation \( c = c' + ab \) demonstrates: [2 pts]

1) **Effect decomposition in mediation** ✓
2) The Sobel test formula
3) Bootstrap confidence intervals
4) The suppression effect

## 6. [Essay, 10pts] Explain the four steps of mediation analysis as proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986)

Include the statistical tests involved in each step.

# Section: True/False

## 7. [TF] The Sobel test directly tests the significance of the indirect effect. → True

## 8. [TF] Bootstrapping requires the assumption of normality for the indirect effect. → False
